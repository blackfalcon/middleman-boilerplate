    Image Brief raised $600,000 in seed funding from a syndicate of Innovation Bay investors.<br />
    <strong>Meet CEO, <span>Simon Moss.</span></strong>
  long_description: |-
    Simon Moss is CEO of [ImageBrief](http://www.imagebrief.com/), the first company in the world to offer a free service to Advertising agencies to source fresh, high-quality photography directly from a moderated, private community of professional photographers, using a crowd-sourcing based business model. Buyers post a brief for an image request, and a community of 2,700+ photographers in 102 countries respond with exact image matches based on usage and budget. 
    #### HOW HAS INNOVATION BAY HELPED YOU ACHIEVE SUCCESS? 
    We raised $600,000 from a syndicate of sophisticated investors who wish to remain anonymous. We had 3 separate proposals all from investors that we met through Innovation Bay. We didn't need to attend any other events - everything came from that one evening's presentation.
    #### APART FROM FUNDING, HAS INNOVATION BAY HELPED IN OTHER WAYS? 
    Innovation Bay has been extremely helpful making ongoing introductions for ImageBrief into investors, journalists and other industry experts in our ecosystem.  This includes a nomination for ImageBrief to be considered for the BRW startups (within which we were successful).
    I am very thankful for everything that the team at Innovation Bay has done. Without them we would not be where we are right now. We've just closed a second round of funding and already expanded our business into London and New York. Innovation Bay gave me a single place to showcase our business and gain essential funding to help capitalise on our opportunity.
